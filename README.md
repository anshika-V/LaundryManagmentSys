It aims at standardizing data, consolidating data ensuring data integrity and reducing inconsistencies, through the use of a highly
computerized process that is stress-free, reliable and quick.

## Requirements

Currently the program uses conio.h for various functionalities.

if you want to run the program on linux shell you can change the line #49 inside the `template.h` to ```getchar();``` for similar functionality.
But it is recommended to run on a windows machine.

## How to Run
Compile the main.cpp using 

```g++ -o main main.cpp```

Run the executable on any compatible shell using

```./main``` for linux based shell
or
```main.exe``` for windows
